//Lineuo file is a two dimensional array with size of #ofNodes x (#ofLevels+1)*2.
//Each row represents a node in the Skip Graph. First two elements of a row are
//nameID and numericalID of the node. Pair of remaining elements in the row
//(lineup[node][2-3],lineup[node][4-5] …) declares its left and right neighbors at each level.

//First row defines a node with nameID and numericalID of “000” and “12”, respectively.
//At level 0,1 and 2, it does not have a left neighbor, because they are denoted by 0.
//At level 0, the node has a right neighbor with numericalID of “28”. At level 1 and 2, the node has
//right neighbors with numericalIDs of “39”.
000 12 0 28 0 39 0 39

//Second row defines a node with nameID and numericalID of “100” and “28”, respectively.
//At level 0, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “12”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “39”.
//At level 1, the node has a right neighbor with numericalID of “71”, and it does not have a left neighbor.
//At level 2, the node does not have any left and right neighbors.

//Third row defines a node with nameID and numericalID of “001” and “39”, respectively.
//At level 0, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “28”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “48”.
//At level 1, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “12”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “48”.
//At level 2, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “12”, and it does not have a right neighbor.

//Forth row defines a node with nameID and numericalID of “010” and “48”, respectively.
//At level 0, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “39”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “55”.
//At level 1, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “39”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “55”.
//At level 2, the node does not have a left neighbor, and it has a right neighbor with numericalID of “55”.

//Fifth row defines a node with nameID and numericalID of “011” and “55”, respectively.
//At level 0, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “48”, and right neighbor with numericalID of “71”.
//At level 1, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “48”, and it does not have a right neighbor.
//At level 2, the node has left neighbor with numericalID of “48”, and it does not have a right neighbor.
